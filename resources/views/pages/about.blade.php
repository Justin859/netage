<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
    Net Age originally started when Goran Giertz, founder and owner, designed his first website in 1997, nearly 20 years ago.  Back then, there was no such thing as Google.  The leading search engine in South Africa at the time was Ananzi, and we used to offer our clients a money back guarantee if we didn’t get them onto the first page.
</p>

<p>
    We’re pleased to say that many of our clients back then are still with us today.  In fact, it was one of those early clients (who’s still with us) that first asked us about Google AdWords.  We did some research into it for him, and more than 10 years later, we’re a Google Premier partner, and that client grew into one of the largest office furniture suppliers in the country.

<p>
    In the beginning, we were a web design and development company, but as the years have gone by, we’ve grown our expertise, and our offering, to include a full range of services able to support the needs of any online business.  We still build websites, and we love doing it, but these days our primary objective is to help our clients grow their business.
</p>

<p>
    As we grew ourselves, we made a deliberate decision that we would not become a cookie-cutter agency, with hundreds of people, and hundreds of clients.  We’re very happy the way we are, and our teams work very closely together in order to achieve our clients objectives.
