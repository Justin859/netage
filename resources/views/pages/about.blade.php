<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
    Net Age originally started when Goran Giertz, founder and owner, designed his first website in 1997, nearly 20 years ago.  Back then, there was no such thing as Google.  The leading search engine in South Africa at the time was Ananzi, and we used to offer our clients a money back guarantee if we didn’t get them onto the first page.
</p>

<p>
    We’re pleased to say that many of our clients back then are still with us today.  In fact, it was one of those early clients (who’s still with us) that first asked us about Google AdWords.  We did some research into it for him, and more than 10 years later, we’re a Google Premier partner, and that client grew into one of the largest office furniture suppliers in the country.

        At Net Age, you're not a number.  You're an active partner in our efforts to help your business grow.
    </p>

<p>
    In the beginning, we were a web design and development company, but as the years have gone by, we’ve grown our expertise, and our offering, to include a full range of services able to support the needs of any online business.  We still build websites, and we love doing it, but these days our primary objective is to help our clients grow their business.
</p>

<p>
    As we grew ourselves, we made a deliberate decision that we would not become a cookie-cutter agency, with hundreds of people, and hundreds of clients.  We’re very happy the way we are, and our teams work very closely together in order to achieve our clients objectives.

        <h3>The Net Age Team</h3>
        <p>
            Net Age wouldn’t be Net Age without the people who make it all happen. Some of our team have been with us from the beginning, some have left and returned, and some of those who started later have stayed with us far longer than usual in this industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to the digital marketing industry, its the people who make it work, and we have some of the best in the industry at Net Age.  And one of the things that makes them the best is that they never assume they know it all.  At Net Age, we’re always learning how to improve ourselves.  Our philosophy is that if you want to do something, then do it.  We push our team to push the boundaries, and they’ve helped us achieve things that others have said can’t be done.

    <h3>Our Client Approach</h3>
    <p>
    We believe that growing our clients business isn’t a once-off proposition. It’s about building long-term relationships, forming bonds, and understanding each other.  We make a point of meeting regularly with our clients, getting their feedback, giving our feedback, and applying the lessons learned on both sides of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our continual development of new tools and products gives us an insight into how clients feel, and what they need, and our own strategy is based on the idea that growing clients businesses will help us grow our own.
